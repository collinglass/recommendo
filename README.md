Go implementation for Programming Collective Intelligence book.

### Usage

1. Navigate to chapter
2. ```make```

### TODO

- Serve data to a client and use google API to visualize data

- Chapter 2

	- deliciousAPI for Golang (so far just parsing to file, maybe next step is to pull in with go and use dataset)

	- Bug in item-based algorithms, prints user 2, 5 when correct is user 2, 4

	- item-based algorithms numbers are very different from user-based algorithms. (is there a bug?)

- Chapter 3

## Objective

Complete go implementation of Programming Collective intelligence book.
