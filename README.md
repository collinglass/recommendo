# Recommendo

A mock recommendation system for a book reading site

### Usage

```go run recommendo.go```

### TODO

- Understand why Euclidean gives 99% matching to 6 on user 0 - possibly bug in algo or is it just how it matches?
- Matching products (optional)
- Serve data to a client and use google API to visualize data

### DONE

- Find Similar Users (Euclidean, Pearson)
- Ranking the critics
- Recommending Items (given a user)

## Objective

Compare two Euclidean Distance and Pearson Correlation algorithms for a recommendation system.

## Plans for the future

Complete go implementation of Programming Collective intelligence book.
